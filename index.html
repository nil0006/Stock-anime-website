        <h1>Why I love Anime</h1>
        <p>I believe that anime is an amazing place for writers to pour their ideas and philosophies into the public mainstream, some of which I think is nearly impossible to be done if attempted in real life.Pretty straight forward. Some of the scenes in anime will probably BLOW YOU AWAY with the visuals that they present. Not gonna lie. Visual aspects or effects in movies can definitely enhance the viewing experience but it also could be its MAIN selling point altogether.</p>
